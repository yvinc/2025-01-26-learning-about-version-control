Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

- What I like most about version control is that in this class I'm finally able to learn and practice slowly how merge conflicts can be so relatively easy resolved. Before it has always been a headache.
- What I find most frustrating about version control is the plethora of command needed to remember to use version control efficiently. I hope that I can learn quicker so that these commands stick with me more, but it takes time to practice.
